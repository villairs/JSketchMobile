NOTE - Changing orientation works but it erases the canvas. I havn't fixed that yet.

Implemented undo and redo.

Can select between 3 different sizes and colours.
Selecting shapes highlights them in pink.
When creating a shape, a black outline is shown.

To erase everything, select erase and touch screen for atleast 0.5 secs.
